# SQL Joins ‚Äì Airbnb Database Project

This section of the project demonstrates the use of SQL joins to retrieve related data across multiple tables in the simulated Airbnb database. The goal is to master INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations by writing real-world queries.

## ‚úÖ Task Objectives

- Retrieve bookings with corresponding users using INNER JOIN.
- Retrieve properties and their reviews using LEFT JOIN, including properties that have no reviews.
- Retrieve all users and all bookings using FULL OUTER JOIN (or a UNION workaround for MySQL).

## üîç Queries Overview

### 1. INNER JOIN ‚Äì Bookings and Users

```sql
SELECT
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name
FROM
    bookings b
INNER JOIN
    users u ON b.user_id = u.id;
```

SELECT
p.id AS property_id,
p.name AS property_name,
r.id AS review_id,
r.rating,
r.comment
FROM
properties p
LEFT JOIN
reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id;
