# SQL Joins ‚Äì Airbnb Database Project

This section of the project demonstrates the use of SQL joins to retrieve related data across multiple tables in the simulated Airbnb database. The goal is to master INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations by writing real-world queries.

## ‚úÖ Task Objectives

- Retrieve bookings with corresponding users using INNER JOIN.
- Retrieve properties and their reviews using LEFT JOIN, including properties that have no reviews.
- Retrieve all users and all bookings using FULL OUTER JOIN (or a UNION workaround for MySQL).

## üîç Queries Overview

### 1. INNER JOIN ‚Äì Bookings and Users

```sql
SELECT
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name
FROM
    bookings b
INNER JOIN
    users u ON b.user_id = u.id;
```

SELECT
p.id AS property_id,
p.name AS property_name,
r.id AS review_id,
r.rating,
r.comment
FROM
properties p
LEFT JOIN
reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id;

# Subqueries ‚Äì Airbnb Database Project

This section of the project focuses on mastering subqueries in SQL. You will learn to use both correlated and non-correlated subqueries to retrieve data based on calculations and nested logic.

## ‚úÖ Task Objectives

- Use a non-correlated subquery to find high-rated properties.
- Use a correlated subquery to find users with more than 3 bookings.

## üîç Queries Overview

### 1. Non-Correlated Subquery ‚Äì High-Rated Properties

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM properties
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT property_id
    FROM reviews
    GROUP BY property_id
    HAVING AVG(rating) > 4.0
)
ORDER BY id;

```

SELECT id, first_name, last_name
FROM users u
WHERE (
SELECT COUNT(\*)
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.user_id = u.id
) > 3
ORDER BY id;

# Aggregations and Window Functions ‚Äì Airbnb Database Project

This section demonstrates how to use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze user and property activity in the Airbnb database.

## ‚úÖ Task Objectives

- Use aggregation (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`) to summarize booking data by user.
- Apply a window function (`RANK`) to rank properties based on popularity (number of bookings).

## üîç Queries Overview

### 1. Total Bookings by Each User

```sql
SELECT
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    COUNT(b.id) AS total_bookings
FROM
    users u
JOIN
    bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
GROUP BY
    u.id, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY
    total_bookings DESC;
```

SELECT
p.id AS property_id,
p.name AS property_name,
COUNT(b.id) AS total_bookings,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.id) DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM
properties p
LEFT JOIN
bookings b ON p.id = b.property_id
GROUP BY
p.id, p.name
ORDER BY
booking_rank;
