# Query Optimization Report

## Initial Query

The original query retrieved all bookings along with user, property, and payment details using multiple joins:

```sql
SELECT
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.id AS user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.id AS property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.id AS payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON pay.booking_id = b.id;
```
